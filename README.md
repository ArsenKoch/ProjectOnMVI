# ProjectOnMVI

This application is a converted application from MVVM to MVI. With the addition of the necessary elements needed for the MVI architecture.
The application itself is simple, consisting in the fact that we write some text, then save it, while receiving a boolean value in the column, which means the text was saved or not, and by clicking on the get data button we get our text back.
